# Access Control Policy

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Access Control Policy is to establish guidelines for managing access to Rate's information systems and data, ensuring that only authorized individuals have appropriate access based on their roles and responsibilities. This policy aligns with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.5.15 requirements.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, temporary staff, and any other personnel at Rate who have access to information assets. It covers all information systems, networks, applications, and data owned or managed by Rate, including but not limited to:

- `dashboard.rate.nl` (Global Admin)
- `dashboard.rate.nl` (Client-specific access)
- `dashdev.rate.nl` (Test & Development Platform)
- Production Servers

## 3. Access Control Principles

Rate adheres to the following principles to manage access effectively:

- **Least Privilege**: Access rights are granted at the minimum level necessary for users to perform their job functions.
- **Need-to-Know**: Access to sensitive information is restricted to individuals who require it for legitimate business purposes.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access permissions are assigned based on defined roles within the organization.

## 4. User Access Management

### 4.1. User Registration and De-registration

- **Registration**: Access requests must be submitted via email to the Tech Lead. For certain access levels, approval from the CEO is required. All access requests are documented in an access control log.
- **De-registration**: Upon termination or role change, the CEO notifies the Tech Lead to revoke or adjust access rights immediately.

### 4.2. User Access Provisioning

- Access is granted based on the user's role and responsibilities.
- The Tech Lead is responsible for configuring access permissions following approval.

### 4.3. Review of User Access Rights

- Access rights are reviewed quarterly by the development team to ensure appropriateness.
- Any discrepancies or unauthorized access are addressed promptly.

## 5. Authentication and Password Management

- **Authentication Methods**: Strong password policies combined with two-factor authentication (2FA) are implemented for all critical systems.
- **Password Policy**:
  - Minimum length: 12 characters
  - Complexity: Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Expiration: Passwords must be changed every 90 days
  - Storage: Passwords are stored securely and must not be shared

## 6. Access Monitoring and Logging

- Access to sensitive data is logged, and logs are reviewed quarterly by the development team to detect any unauthorized access attempts.
- Logs are retained for a minimum of one year for auditing purposes.

## 7. Physical Access Control

- Key card access systems are utilized for building entry, and keys are required for office entry.
- Access to areas containing sensitive information or critical systems is restricted to authorized personnel only.
