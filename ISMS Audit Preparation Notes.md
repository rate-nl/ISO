|----|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| 1  | Clause 4.1 – Internal & External Issues | Not explicitly documented, though implied through risks.                                                                                                             | Add a short subsection listing internal (e.g., small team, tech stack) and external (e.g., GDPR, customers). | Medium   |
| 2  | Clause 5.4 – ISMS Integration    | ISMS integration with business strategy is implemented but not explicitly mentioned.                                                                                  | Add a paragraph confirming that ISMS is integrated into daily business operations and strategic planning.    | Low      |
| 3  | Clause 7.4 – Communication       | Communication strategy (internal/external) not explicitly documented.                                                                                                 | Add a section outlining how incidents, risks, and updates are communicated (e.g., via email, Trello, Slack). | Medium   |
| 4  | Clause 9.1 – KPI Results         | KPIs have defined targets but **no actual results** are listed (e.g., “0 violations” or “3 restores tested”).                                                        | Add a summary table of **last year’s KPI values** to demonstrate performance.                                | High     |
| 5  | Annex A – Control A.5.2, A.5.4, A.5.8 | Marked ❌ not applicable, but controls are **partially or fully implemented** through ISMS structure.                                                                  | Mark these ✅ applicable and link to existing implementation (roles, dev process, governance).                | Medium   |
| 6  | Evidence Log – Patch/Update Log | Section exists but no entries shown. Could appear incomplete during audit.                                                                                            | Add at least **one real patch entry** with date/system/description.                                         | High     |
| 7  | Evidence Log – Risk Assessment  | “Old assessments tracked via Trello” is vague and not easily auditable.                                                                                               | Upload at least **one recent risk assessment** as a document with summary.                                  | High     |

| 9  | Clause 6 / Clause 8 – SoA-to-Policy Reference | You have a few “tight justifications” in SoA, but some could benefit from **explicit policy links**.                                                                  | Add specific hyperlinks or section names from the ISMS manual for 2–3 critical controls (e.g., A.5.13).      | Low      |
