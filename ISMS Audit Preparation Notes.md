| 4  | Clause 9.1 – KPI Results         | KPIs have defined targets but **no actual results** are listed (e.g., “0 violations” or “3 restores tested”).                                                        | Add a summary table of **last year’s KPI values** to demonstrate performance.                                | 🔴 High |

| 8  | Clause 6 / Clause 8 – SoA-to-Policy Reference | You have a few “tight justifications” in SoA, but some could benefit from **explicit policy links**.                                                                  | Add specific hyperlinks or section names from the ISMS manual for 2–3 critical controls (e.g., A.5.13).      | 🟢 Low |
