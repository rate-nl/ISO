- After development, issues and solutions are documented in the knowledge base.
- Testing is performed before deployment.
- All changes must be **approved by the Team Lead Developer** before deployment.

### 3. Urgent or Blocked Tasks

- Urgent tasks are prioritized and fast-tracked through the workflow.
- Cards can be blocked at any point pending information or decisions.

### 4. Documentation and Retention

- Each card includes a short description of changes and test results.
- Final versions are archived once deployment and stakeholder communication are completed.
- All production changes are recorded in the **[Change Management Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aTAYJK-ycFjJh9wI8hkGKIsSFxHTPhW5TxiL7bMx1hA/edit?gid=2142384983#gid=2142384983)** .

## **3. Justification for Exclusions**

These exclusions are based on:

* The absence of relevant business operations requiring these controls.
* The use of alternative security measures to mitigate associated risks.
* The reliance on cloud-based infrastructure, reducing physical security concerns.

The following Annex A controls were evaluated and determined to be **not applicable** to Rateâ€™s ISMS scope. Justifications are based on the organizationâ€™s operations, infrastructure, and risk assessment results.
